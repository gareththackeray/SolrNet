SolrNet 0.4.0 - ASOSMP branch.
Solr client for .NET
http://code.google.com/p/solrnet/

This release is built against:
Castle Windsor 2.5

It currently differs from the main repo in the following ways:

1. I've added support for commitWithin on a delete call (and issued a pull request, so this may make its way into the trunk)
2. it uses Castle Windsor 2.5 targetting framework v4.0, whereas the trunk uses 3.0 targetting framework v3.5.
3. the branch solution does contain the projects we don't use
4. there is an assembly key file (generated by us)

Should you need to make any changes to this, just clone the above repo, checkout the AsosMp branch and you should be able to build it using the Release.bat file.  The merged binary goes into \merged.

Obviously if you want to get changes from mainstream solrnet development you'll need to pull them in and deal with the consequences!
